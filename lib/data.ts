//"as const" forces TypeScript to treat the values as their literal types and marks them as readonly.
// It provides type safety by ensuring immutability and preventing changes to the data.
// Itâ€™s especially useful for creating union types from arrays or objects, as it narrows down the type to the exact values.

//Key Features of as const:
// Literal Type Inference:

// Normally, when you define an object or array, TypeScript will infer general types for the values. Using as const forces TypeScript to infer literal types instead.
// Literal types are the exact values themselves, rather than broader types like string or number.
// Readonly:

// The as const assertion also marks the array or object as readonly, meaning that the values cannot be changed. It prevents the reassignment of values at the type level.
