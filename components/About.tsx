// This wraps the entire section, enabling animations when the component is mounted.
// ref={ref}: The ref from the useSectionInView hook is attached here to track this sectionâ€™s visibility on the page.

// Animation Props:
// initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 100 }}: The section starts with zero opacity and is shifted down by 100 pixels (off-screen).
// animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}: When animated, the opacity transitions to 1, and the section moves back to its normal position (y: 0).
// transition={{ delay: 0.175 }}: The animation has a delay of 0.175 seconds before starting.
